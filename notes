type of error - NameError: Uninitialized Constant
file path - /Users/username/.rbenv/versions/2.6.3/bin/irb
line number - 23

You'll see this error when the code refers to a class or module that it can't find, often because 
the code doesn't include require, which instructs the Ruby file to load the class.

In Ruby, variables/methods begin with lowercase letters, while classes begin with uppercase letters. 
If the code doesn't reflect this distinction, you'll receive the Uninitialized Constant exception.

Still another possible cause for the NameError error is that you've made a simple typo in the code. 

Ruby is case sensitive, so "TestCode" and "Testcode" are completely different. 

The code contains mention of rubygems, which is deprecated in all but old versions of Ruby.

Figure out which of these ^^ is the problem, deal with it.
In this case Ruby doesn't know what DockingStation is because we haven't defined it yet.
